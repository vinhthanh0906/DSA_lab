Exercise 4:
Write a pseudo-code by commenting in the file then implement a program in to
enter a natural number n and verify whether n is sphenic. Calculate the complexity
of your program.
Note: A sphenic number is a product of p*q*r where p, q, and r are three distinct
prime numbers. Example: 30 = 2 * 3* 5; 42 = 2*3*7; 66 = 2*3*11


Solve:
- Input the number n = 42;
- Run a for loop from 1 to n:
    + If n divisible for i, print i
- Prime elements of product check
    + count = 0
    + if i%1 and i%i => count +=1 (count = 2 -> prime)
=> prime number = [2,3,7]
- Take three min value in the list 
=> 2,3,7 (1 is not prime number)
